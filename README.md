## About LeetCode

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a popular platform for practicing coding interviews. It offers a vast collection of coding problems, ranging from easy to hard, categorized by topics such as arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, dynamic programming, and more. Many tech companies, including FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google), frequently use LeetCode for technical interviews.

## Folder Structure

This repository is organized into folders based on the question numbers. Each folder contains solutions to a specific LeetCode problem, along with explanations where necessary. The folder structure is as follows:

```
leetcode-150-interview-practice
│
├── Array&String
│   ├── solution.cpp
│   └── explanation.md
├── problem-2/
│   ├── solution.ext
│   └── explanation.md
├── ...
│
└── problem-150/
    ├── solution.ext
    └── explanation.md
```

Replace `problem-x` with the corresponding LeetCode problem number, `solution.ext` with the solution file (e.g., solution.py, solution.java), and `explanation.md` with a markdown file providing an explanation of the solution.
